# Recipe Book Project
This is my first project, after I learned via YouTube videos. <br>
In this project, you can save all your best recipes! <br>
You can finally lose the old books, and find your desired recipe within seconds!

# Technologies Used
Frontend - React (Router, Link, useState, useEffect), axios (for http requests). <br>
Backend - NodeJS + MongoDB (for users CRUD, recipes CRUD), middleware, JWT, MVC, Router
